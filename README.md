small scripts and tools to help with my pixelart projects

## SimpleFontChecker
This is a small n simple JavaScript to check how a bitmap font looks "in real" on char next to each other - even if you are pixeling a font, you may have some issues to check one char against other bitmap chars.
No realwords, this is just a random mapping of chars - to see maybe some drawing issues. And some programmers always tend do have there own love for which orders font should be - so no need to give a char order to keep this test flexible ;).
So this loads a img with the bitmap font - (in this example just font.png) and checks for 5 variables in the script.js file:

  canvas.width = 1024; //size x preview
  canvas.height = 1024; //size y preview

  const gridW = 16, //x font width
        gridH = 16, //y font heigth
        ignoreChars = [0,3,4,5,6,7,10,15,28,30,32,59] //just the plain tile number of the chars to ignore, keep that array empty if you donÂ´t want to skip any
        ;

And yes, the font was pixeled by me.
